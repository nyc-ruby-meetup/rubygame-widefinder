= RubyGame Widefinder

This RubyGame is based on the Widefinder challenge. The goal of the challenge is to read a logfile and figure out which articles have been fetched the most.

Make the test past and run your benchmarks...let's see what you got!

If time permits, commit a branch with your solution and we can take a look at all of them together at the end.
